++++++++++++  Code and executable  ++++++++++++ 

Folder "Code" includes the following files and folders:

Main-BPP.cpp
kbest-KP-Library
Source-Exact

By building the code one should obtain an executable. It can be executed in folder "Instance" where an input file is available. 

In this folder we do not include the DLL for Cplex and Gurobi. In our computational experiment we use "cplex2211.dll" and "gurobi50.dll".

Folder "Instance":

This folder includes the input file "InputTests.pro" containing the parameters for generating and solving test instances.

By running the executable we obtain the output files "Exact-Tab.out" and "Exact-Tab.out" containing a table summarizing the computational results (i.e., those reported in the paper).
